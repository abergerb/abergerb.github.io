  Having owned a camera for 8 years, my enthusiasm for capturing and creating memberable concepts have grown and more than that provided me with good baggage and partnerships.
  With this perspective in mind i have managed and produced products in multiple fields: SAS (Gaming), FinTech, Social Network platform. All of which were excellent efforts, that have lead me to seek a grater volume of work that will further HAVE ME GOING.
  "I look forward to helping you", sound harsh...i am HERE
